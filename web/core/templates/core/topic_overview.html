                            The White House and several AI initiatives such as the Allen Institute for AI posed 10 questions as
                            tasks for the
                            <a class="muted-white" href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/">
                                COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge on Kaggle</a>.
                            These tasks cover important topics in the context of COVID-19, where solutions, ideas and
                            discussions are required as fast as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since a lot of research papers cover exactly these questions, we misuse them to classify the
                            COVID-19 preprints.
